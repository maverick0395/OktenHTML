<h1>Rick Astley</h1>
<p>Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer, songwriter and radio personality, who has been
    active in music for several decades. He gained worldwide fame in the 1980s, having multiple hits including his
    signature song "Never Gonna Give You Up", "Together Forever" and "Whenever You Need Somebody", and returned to music
    full-time in the 2000s. Outside his music career, Astley has occasionally worked as a radio DJ and a podcaster.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Lancashire, Astley became a musician after leaving school, as the drummer for the soul band FBI.
    Three years later, he rose to fame through his association with the production trio Stock Aitken Waterman; releasing
    the 1987 album Whenever You Need Somebody, which sold 15.2 million copies worldwide. His debut single "Never Gonna
    Give You Up" was a number 1 hit single in 25 countries, winning the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single.
    His 1988 single "Together Forever" became his second single to top the US Billboard Hot 100, and was one of his
    eight songs to reach the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. The title track was a No 1 single in seven countries, and
    it reached No 3 in the UK. In 1988, Astley followed-up his debut album with Hold Me In Your Arms. The lead single
    "She Wants to Dance with Me" was Astley's first single that he wrote himself, and became a worldwide top 10 hit.</p>
<p>In 1991, Astley left Stoke Aitken Waterman and moved his musical direction away from dance-pop and towards soul,
    which he explored on his albums Free (1991) and Body and Soul (1993). His 1991 single "Cry for Help" was Astley's
    last single to reach the top 10 in either the US or UK. From 1994 to 2000, Astley retired from music to focus on
    spending time with his wife and raising their daughter. He returned to the music industry in 2000, and released the
    single "Sleeping" and the album Keep It Turned On in 2001. Four years later, Astley released his covers album
    Portrait.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<p>In 1985, Astley was performing as a drummer with a soul band named FBI, with Morris on guitar. They were a well-known
    local band writing and performing their own music, gigging in pubs and clubs. When FBI's lead singer left the band,
    and Morris left to concentrate on his career in hairdressing,Astley offered to be the lead vocalist. This was
    when he was noticed by the record producer Pete Waterman, who persuaded him to come to London to work at the Pete
    Waterman Limited (PWL) recording studio, with RCA Records publishing his records. Under the tutelage of the
    production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW), Astley was
    taught about the recording process and groomed for his future career, supposedly starting off as the recording
    studio "tea boy". The reason for Astley to be hired as a "tape op" was to overcome his shyness.SAW also hired
    most of FBI, including Morris as a guitarist/songwriter.</p>
