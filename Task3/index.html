    <p class="content_position text_style">Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an
        English singer, songwriter and radio personality, who has been active in music for several decades. He gained
        worldwide fame in the 1980s, having multiple hits including his
        signature song "Never Gonna Give You Up", "Together Forever" and "Whenever You Need Somebody", and returned to
        music
        full-time in the 2000s. Outside his music career, Astley has occasionally worked as a radio DJ and a
        podcaster.</p>
    <p class="content_position text_style">Born and raised in Lancashire, Astley became a
        musician after leaving
        school,
        as
        the drummer
        for the soul band
        FBI.
        Three years later, he rose to fame through his association with the production trio Stock Aitken Waterman;
        releasing
        the 1987 album Whenever You Need Somebody, which sold 15.2 million copies worldwide. His debut single "Never
        Gonna
        Give You Up" was a number 1 hit single in 25 countries, winning the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single.
        His 1988 single "Together Forever" became his second single to top the US Billboard Hot 100, and was one of his
        eight songs to reach the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. The title track was a No 1 single in seven countries,
        and
        it reached No 3 in the UK. In 1988, Astley followed-up his debut album with Hold Me In Your Arms. The lead
        single
        "She Wants to Dance with Me" was Astley's first single that he wrote himself, and became a worldwide top 10
        hit.</p>
    <p class="content_position text_style">In 1991, Astley left Stoke Aitken Waterman and moved
        his musical direction
        away
        from
        dance-pop and towards soul,
        which he explored on his albums Free (1991) and Body and Soul (1993). His 1991 single "Cry for Help" was
        Astley's
        last single to reach the top 10 in either the US or UK. From 1994 to 2000, Astley retired from music to focus on
        spending time with his wife and raising their daughter. He returned to the music industry in 2000, and released
        the
        single "Sleeping" and the album Keep It Turned On in 2001. Four years later, Astley released his covers album
        Portrait.</p>

        <h2 class="header_position">Career</h2>
        <p class="content_position text_style">In 1985, Astley was performing as a drummer with a soul band named FBI,
            with
            Morris on
            guitar. They were a
            well-known
            local band writing and performing their own music, gigging in pubs and clubs. When FBI's lead singer left
            the
            band,
            and Morris left to concentrate on his career in hairdressing,Astley offered to be the lead vocalist. This
            was
            when he was noticed by the record producer Pete Waterman, who persuaded him to come to London to work at the
            Pete
            Waterman Limited (PWL) recording studio, with RCA Records publishing his records. Under the tutelage of the
            production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW), Astley
            was
            taught about the recording process and groomed for his future career, supposedly starting off as the
            recording
            studio "tea boy". The reason for Astley to be hired as a "tape op" was to overcome his shyness.SAW also
            hired
            most of FBI, including Morris as a guitarist/songwriter.</p></div>
